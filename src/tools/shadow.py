"""
Stage B of the function-calling migration: shadow-mode comparison. Every
text message the OLD classifier (intent_parser.parse_message) already
handled is ALSO run through the new tools pipeline, purely for comparison
logging. The old classifier's result is what the user actually gets - this
module's output is never sent to anyone and never affects any reply, never
touches result/reply, never re-runs a side effect (it only classifies, it
never calls execute_tool - a shadow-mode "add milk to my list" must not
actually add milk to the list twice).

Runs on a background thread (same "never add to the user's perceived
response time" pattern as db.models._embed_message_in_background) and is
exception-isolated at every layer - a Gemini failure, a bug in the new
pipeline, a DB write failure - none of it can ever affect what the live bot
sends back. That is the entire point of a shadow phase.
