"""
Decision engine for the proactive assistant ("Context-Aware Gatekeeper",
planned 2026-09-27). Two layers, both required before anything reaches the
user:

1. assess_situation/assess_and_deliver - the real "should this interrupt
   the user at all" judgment call, using an LLM as a filtering/decision
   engine that cross-references the user's own calendar and today's
   already-sent count (the admin's own explicit framing, confirmed live the
   same day this was added - see the module docstring history). Every
   collector calls assess_and_deliver, never deliver_proactive_message
   directly, so a genuinely new collector can't skip this judgment step.
2. should_deliver_now/deliver_proactive_message - the deterministic policy
   underneath (quiet hours, an explicit "I'm busy" status, VIP bypass, and
   a hard daily cap) that ALWAYS applies regardless of what the LLM
   decided - a "yes, interrupt" from assess_situation can still be blocked
   by quiet hours. A user who has never touched manage_proactive_settings
   has no settings row at all (opt-in by default, per the admin's own
   requirement) and is always blocked here.

Deliberately does NOT defer a blocked notification to the next free window
yet (the "hold and deliver later" behavior discussed in planning) - stage 1
just skips it. That's a real, known gap, not an oversight; flagged for a
later stage once a real queue is worth building.

    The single entry point collectors should call: checks should_deliver_now,
    reserves a daily-cap slot, sends via Telegram if allowed, and releases
    the slot again if the send itself failed. Returns whether it was
    actually sent.

    Defer fix (2026-09-27, closes the stage-1 known gap): a block for
    quiet_hours or status_busy is a TIMING constraint, not a "never" - the
    message is held (defer_proactive_message) instead of dropped, and
    delivered once the window opens (see scheduler.check_and_deliver_
    deferred_notifications, which combines multiple held messages into one
    digest rather than resending each individually). daily_cap_reached and
    proactive_disabled are NOT deferred - the cap is a volume limiter, not
    a timing one (piling up capped messages for the moment the cap resets
    would defeat its own purpose), and "disabled" has no future window to
    wait for at all.

    Race fix (2026-09-27): should_deliver_now's own cap check is a fast,
    non-atomic pre-check (cheap - no write) that rejects the common case
    early. The actual gate is reserve_proactive_notification_slot right
    before sending - a single atomic SQL statement, so two collectors
    racing for the same user's last slot can no longer both get through
    (see that function's own docstring for the full reasoning - the old
    check-then-separately-log pattern had a real TOCTOU gap between
