"""
Stocks and crypto via the unofficial (but stable and widely used) Yahoo
Finance endpoint, with no API key. The same endpoint covers both stocks and
crypto (with a -USD suffix), so no second provider is needed.

WARNING: this is an unofficial endpoint (Yahoo shut down their official API in
2017). It works and is stable as of today, but Yahoo may change or block it
without notice. If that happens, switch to another provider (for example
Alpha Vantage, which requires an API key).
