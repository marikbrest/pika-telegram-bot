"""
Read-only queries against the UniFi Network Integration API - client count
and whether the gateway is reachable, for the same admin-only home-infra
status query that already reports Zabbix problems.

Uses a dedicated "pika-bot" API key (not a key shared with other tools) - same least-privilege reasoning as the
dedicated Zabbix API token: if this key leaks, its blast radius is isolated
and audit trails show which consumer made which call.

Verified empirically against the live controller (v1 Integration API,
firmware as of 2026-09): there is no dedicated WAN/internet sub-object at
this API level - `problem.get`-style guessing at a field that doesn't exist
was exactly the mistake made and fixed for Zabbix earlier, so here the
gateway's own top-level `state` field is used as the reachability signal
instead, the same kind of proxy already relied on for Zabbix's ICMP checks.
