"""
Stage A of the function-calling migration (see the 2026-09-13 session for the
full plan): a provider-neutral tool registry. Nothing here imports from
google.genai - src/tools/gemini_adapter.py is the only file that translates
this into what the Gemini SDK wants, so a future provider swap or an MCP
export only ever touches that one file.

Two verified-live design decisions this registry encodes (see
smoke_function_call.py / smoke_reply_arg.py from the same session):

1. Gemini's function-calling mode is ANY, not AUTO - every message maps to
   exactly one of N named tools, always (chat and unclear are real,
   registered tools, not "the model declined to call anything"). This is
   the closest match to today's intent_parser.py, which already treats
   "chat"/"unclear" as explicit categories in an exhaustive whitelist, not a
   fallback state.

2. In ANY mode, Gemini does NOT emit free text alongside a function call
   (response.text comes back None - confirmed empirically). Today, ~5 of 20
   intents (reminder, add_contact, connect_google, email_draft) rely on
   Gemini's own generated sentence AS the reply, not a code-computed one.
   Rather than a second Gemini round-trip to get that text (which today's
   single-call design never needed), renders_own_reply=False tools simply
   carry a "reply_text" argument as part of their OWN schema, filled by
   Gemini in the same call as every other argument - verified this produces
   natural, correctly-language-matched text exactly like today's
   result["reply"] does. No tool registered so far needs more than one
   Gemini call; the step-loop in gemini_adapter.py exists for a FUTURE tool
   that genuinely needs to see its own result before responding (e.g. "read
   this email thread, now summarize it"), not because today's 20 intents do.

    The subset of tools a given user's message may be classified against.
    Excluding an admin-only tool here means Gemini physically cannot choose
    it for a non-admin user - real defence, not just a token-count
    optimization - but it is a SECOND layer, not a replacement for the
    handler's own is_admin check: a bug here (or a future tool registered
    without going through tools_for) must not become a privilege
    escalation. Handlers keep checking admin status themselves, exactly as
    _handle_zabbix_status/_handle_usage_status/_handle_user_manage already
    do today.

    user is `.get()`-accessed via dict(user), not user.get(...) directly:
    real production callers pass a sqlite3.Row (from
    get_user_by_chat_id), which supports row["key"] but has no
    .get() method at all - AttributeError, not a wrong answer. This was
    latent since Stage A (every test here used a plain dict) and only
    surfaced once batch 5 registered the first admin_only=True tool, which
    finally made the right-hand side of the `or` actually evaluate for a
    real webhook-driven user instead of always short-circuiting on
    `not t.admin_only` first. dict(row) works for both a sqlite3.Row and an
    already-plain dict, so this fix does not change behaviour for any
    existing caller.
