"""
Batch 4 of the function-calling migration (2026-09-14): reminder,
add_contact, connect_google - the first tools in this migration that need
Gemini's own generated sentence as (part of) the reply, not a purely
code-computed one.

Design note - a deliberate departure from Stage A's original plan: the
registry docstring anticipated a renders_own_reply=False path (reply is
ALWAYS exactly args["reply_text"], handler's return value ignored) for
exactly these three. That fits add_contact perfectly, but not the other two:
reminder needs to return a DIFFERENT, code-computed message when the named
recipient isn't a saved contact yet (Gemini cannot know that at
classification time), and connect_google needs to APPEND a real auth URL
after Gemini's sentence, not replace it. Neither fits "reply is always
exactly reply_text, no way to override or extend it". All three are
therefore renders_own_reply=True instead, with "reply_text" simply a normal
schema field the handler chooses to use, compose with, or override - still
exactly the "Gemini writes the sentence in the same call, no second
round-trip" property Stage A wanted, just without the rigid dispatch
shortcut that only actually fits one of the three tools.

Handlers are thin: _handle_reminder/_handle_add_contact/_handle_connect_google
were extracted from webhook_handler.py's own inline dispatch logic the same
day (not reimplemented), so the old classifier's "reminder"/"add_contact"/
"connect_google" intents and these tools share one real implementation each.
