"""
New feature (2026-09-15): manage_kids_schedule. the admin wants to save each of
his kids' weekly school/activity timetable and have the bot proactively
remind him every evening what tomorrow looks like, instead of only reacting
to on-demand requests the way every other tool so far does. The proactive
half (scheduler.check_and_send_kids_schedule_reminders) is separate
infrastructure that needs no wiring here - this tool is only the chat-driven
CRUD side: set/set_week/list/delete for a kid's timetable. day_of_week
reuses the same mon/tue/.../sun convention create_reminder's schedule_days
already uses, rather than inventing a new day format.

set_week (2026-09-15 same-day addition): lets a photo of a printed/
handwritten weekly schedule board save every visible day in one call,
instead of the user typing each day separately. The image never reaches
this tool directly - it goes through the existing two-step media pipeline
(_transcribe_media describes/transcribes it to text first, see that
function's own prompt for the schedule-board-specific instructions added
alongside its existing receipt/document handling), and THIS tool's schema
is what the resulting text gets classified against, exactly like any other
media message.

"list" also backs a kid asking about their OWN schedule (see
webhook_handler._handle_kids_schedule's phone-number fallback) - a
registered kid-user with no schedule of their own under their own account
resolves to whatever their parent saved for them, found by matching the
kid's own Telegram chat id against a contact a parent saved.
