# Changelog

All notable changes to this project. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **This repository is the Telegram edition of Pika**, forked from
  [pika-personal-whatsapp-bot](https://github.com/marikbrest/pika-personal-whatsapp-bot) at the `LOCALE` release. WhatsApp is removed:
  new `src/integrations/telegram.py` (Bot API client with retries, chunking, reactions, photos, media download) and
  `src/telegram_handler.py` (long polling by default - no public URL needed - or a webhook protected by a secret header). Telegram updates are
  normalised to the existing internal message shape, so the whole tool pipeline is unchanged. Users are identified by Telegram chat id
  (`users.chat_id`, was a phone number); message templates, the 24-hour window and Meta signature checks are gone. New `.env` variables:
  `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_MODE`, `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Guide: `docs/SETUP_TELEGRAM.md`.
- The history below this entry describes the WhatsApp edition.

### Added
- **`LOCALE` setting (`he` default, `en`).** Messages the code composes itself (confirmations, reminders, calendar/email alerts, package
  updates, daily summaries, the "what can you do" list, the privacy text, the welcome message, the Google-connected page, weather and
  integration status lines) now come from catalogs in `src/locales/` through `t()` (`src/i18n.py`). Hebrew output is unchanged. Prompts that
  produce user-facing text tell the model which language to answer in; the weather lookup follows `LOCALE`. Tests check that the catalogs have
  the same keys and placeholders and that English output contains no Hebrew; `doctor.py` warns when `LOCALE` and
  `WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_LANGUAGE` differ. Not translated yet: the admin dashboard, tool descriptions, internal classification prompts.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- **OpenAI as an optional AI provider**, chosen per user ("switch to OpenAI" / "switch to Gemini" / "which model am I using?") and applied to their
  proactive alerts too. Provider registry in `src/ai.py`; OpenAI adapter on the Responses API (`store: false`, strict validated tool calls, no
  fallback to the other provider, no content in logs); usage and cost in the usage report; `/privacy` and the welcome message name OpenAI
  automatically when enabled; `doctor.py` checks the settings. Embeddings and image generation stay on Gemini. Guide: `docs/ADDING_A_PROVIDER.md`. ([#2](https://github.com/marikbrest/pika-personal-whatsapp-bot/issues/2))
- `GEMINI_MODEL` setting (default `gemini-flash-latest`).

## [0.3.5] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- `CLAUDE.md`: tells Claude Code (or any coding agent) exactly how to install, validate, run and change the project. ([README](./README.md))
- `mypy` in CI for `src/db/models.py`, `src/proactive.py`, `src/tools/registry.py` (all untyped defs annotated; `disallow_untyped_defs`). ([#6](https://github.com/marikbrest/pika-personal-whatsapp-bot/issues/6))
- Coverage table on each CI run's summary (`pytest-cov`, baseline 74%) and a note in CONTRIBUTING. ([#7](https://github.com/marikbrest/pika-personal-whatsapp-bot/issues/7))
- Test that every registered tool is listed in the "what can you do?" groups (or explicitly exempt).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- `scripts/delete_user.py` (`--dry-run`, `--contacts`): remove a user and all their data in one transaction, revoking their Google grant. ([#18](https://github.com/marikbrest/pika-personal-whatsapp-bot/issues/18))
- One-time welcome message with the `/privacy` and `/terms` links when a user is added (new `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `welcome_user` template, `doctor.py` check). ([#17](https://github.com/marikbrest/pika-personal-whatsapp-bot/issues/17))

### Security
- Admin dashboard: URL-encode the redirect message, cast ids to int in rendered forms, and do not echo a file-read exception into the logs page (CodeQL findings).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- `doctor.py` warns when `OPERATOR_NAME` / `ADMIN_CONTACT_EMAIL` are unset (they appear on the public `/privacy` and
  `/terms` pages) and reminds you to use a billing-enabled Gemini project when Google is connected.
- `.env.example` and README say which Gemini tier the privacy policy is true for.
- `SUPPORT.md`; two privacy-related items on the ROADMAP.
- `docs/SETUP_META.md`: "Adding a person" section - the two approvals (Meta recipient list and the bot's allowlist) and a no-answer troubleshooting table.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- `/terms` page, and a bilingual (English/Hebrew) `/privacy` page: names the operator (new `OPERATOR_NAME`)
  and recipients, Google API Limited Use disclosure, retention, user rights, third-party contacts, children.
- `docs/TERMS_TEMPLATE.md`, plus Hebrew versions of it and of the operator privacy guide.
- README note that whoever hosts the bot is the operator and can technically read the database.

### Changed
- `/privacy` now names Gemini and Meta as recipients and no longer claims nobody can see the data
  (the server's operator can); it previously said data is "never shared with a third party".

## [0.3.1] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- `WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_LANGUAGE` setting (was a hardcoded `he` in two places).
- CI tests Python 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14; the README now states 3.12+.

### Fixed
- Adding a contact crashed with a generic error reply, and `web_search`/`connect_google` ran twice (a second
  search, a second OAuth link): these tool names match old intent names, so the legacy dispatch re-ran them.
- Without `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`, Google requests (connect, calendar, Drive, Gmail) replied with a generic
  error; they now say Google is not configured yet.
- Web search could answer a Hebrew question in English (the classifier may rephrase the query in English).
- A persistent-reminder test measured its reschedule from module import time and failed intermittently on slow runs.

### Changed
- Dependabot updates: fastapi 0.142, uvicorn 0.54, google-auth 2.59, google-cloud-bigquery 3.45.2, GitHub Actions.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-02

### Security
- Admin dashboard fails closed: it is off until `ADMIN_ALLOWED_EMAIL` is set (previously an empty value let any
  Cloudflare Access identity in).
- Optional verification of the signed Cloudflare Access JWT (`CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN`, `CF_ACCESS_AUD`, PyJWT 2.15.1),
  so a forged `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email` header no longer grants access.

### Added
- `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` and `DEFAULT_LOCATION` settings for deployments outside Israel; `doctor.py` checks them and the
  dashboard identity mode.

### Changed
- Dependency updates from Dependabot (google-genai 2.25, apscheduler 3.11, GitHub Actions majors).
- Gemini calls explicitly disable the SDK's automatic function calling (the bot dispatches tools itself), which
  also silences a confusing warning google-genai 2.x prints otherwise.
- Proactive-delivery tests pin the clock; previously ten of them failed whenever the suite ran during the
  default quiet hours (22:30-07:00 Israel time).
- README is explicit that Pika is Hebrew-first (understands English; code-composed replies are Hebrew).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-10-02

### Security
- `cryptography` 49.0.0 → 50.0.2 (clears the last open Dependabot advisory).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-02

### Security
- Bumped `cryptography` 43.0.1 → 49.0.0 (it encrypts stored Google tokens), `python-multipart` 0.0.20 → 0.0.32,
  `python-dotenv` 1.0.1 → 1.2.3 and `pytest` → 9.1.1 to clear 27 open Dependabot advisories (12 high).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added
- Docker image runs as a non-root user and has a health check.
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/COSTS.md` (real usage numbers), `docs/PRIVACY_FOR_OPERATORS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`.
- CodeQL scanning, secret scanning with push protection, Dependabot alerts.

### Upgrade note
- Existing Docker volumes created by 0.1.x are owned by root; run `docker compose run --rm --user root bot chown -R 10001 /data` once.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed
- Docker image is now multi-arch (amd64 + arm64), so it runs on Apple Silicon and Raspberry Pi.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-02

First public release.

### Added
- WhatsApp assistant (Gemini function-calling) with reminders, persistent "nag until done" reminders,
  Google Calendar / Gmail / Drive with approval flows, weather and markets, web search, package
  tracking, change watches, image generation and editing, saved links, long-term memory.
- Opt-in proactive mode: LLM situation assessment plus a deterministic delivery policy (quiet hours,
  daily cap, VIP list, busy status, held-for-later digests); meeting briefings; cost guard.
- Multi-user isolation, admin dashboard (counts only, audit-logged), privacy tools.
- `scripts/chat.py` terminal sandbox (no WhatsApp/Meta needed), `scripts/doctor.py` setup checker,
  `scripts/create_admin.py`, cross-platform `scripts/backup_db.py`.
- Docker image and compose file, with an optional Cloudflare Tunnel profile.
- Docs: Meta setup guide, "adding a tool" guide.
