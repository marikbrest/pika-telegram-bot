Regression test for step 0 of the function-calling migration: messages.
parsed_intent has existed in schema.sql since the first commit but was never
actually written until now - there was no way to build a before/after
regression baseline for a classifier change without it. This locks in that
save_incoming_message actually persists what it's given.
