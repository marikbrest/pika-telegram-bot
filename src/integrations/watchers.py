"""
Pluggable checkers for the generic watch engine (src.scheduler.check_watches).

Each checker's only job is "what is the current state of this target right
now", as a comparable string - the scheduler owns all change-detection and
notification logic, exactly like check_and_notify_package_changes already
does for packages specifically. Adding a new watch_type means adding one
checker function here and one line in CHECKERS/NOTIFY_MESSAGES; nothing in
scheduler.py needs to change.

A checker returns None to mean "could not determine the state this time"
(a transient failure) - the scheduler treats that as "try again next cycle",
never as "nothing changed" and never as a reason to notify.
