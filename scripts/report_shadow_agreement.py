"""
Stage B report: how often does the new tools pipeline agree with the old
classifier, on real live traffic?

Read-only - queries intent_shadow_log (populated in the background by
src.tools.shadow, never acted on). Splits into two groups deliberately:

- "migrated" rows: old_intent is one of weather/market/task_manage - the 3
  tools that actually exist in the new pipeline so far. Agreement here is
  the real signal this migration cares about right now.
- everything else: old_intent was something the new pipeline has no tool
  for yet (calendar, email, ...), so it correctly falls back to chat/unclear
  almost always. That is NOT disagreement in any meaningful sense - it is
  exactly what should happen with only 3 of ~20 tools migrated, comparing 20
  options against 5. Shown separately so it never gets mixed into the one
  number that actually matters for a cutover decision.
