"""
Batch 5 of the function-calling migration (2026-09-14): user_manage,
zabbix_status, usage_status, email_read. The first batch to register
admin_only=True tools - tools_for() already excludes them from a non-admin
user's classification entirely (registry.py's own defense-in-depth design),
and every handler here ALSO independently re-checks user["is_admin"] itself
(the same second layer every one of these handlers already had before this
migration touched them) - a bug in tools_for() filtering must never become a
privilege escalation on its own.

email_read is the one non-admin tool in this batch - included because it's
otherwise exactly the same shape as every other batch (renders_own_reply=
True, no pending state) and its boundary against analyze_email (batch 2) is
worth completing as an explicit pair now that both sides exist as real tools.
