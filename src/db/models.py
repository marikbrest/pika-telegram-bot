    number that is CURRENTLY due/mid-cycle (next_trigger_at <= now), if

    treating an incoming message as a possible "I did it" confirmation.
    Resolves by matching the recipient's own number against the contact
    row, the same phone-number-based technique
    find_kid_schedule_owner_by_chat_id already uses - a kid
    confirming is a registered user in their own right, not the owner of
    the reminder they're confirming.

    2026-09-18 bug fix: a recurring (daily/weekly) reminder stays
    status='pending' FOREVER between occurrences (see
    reschedule_persistent_reminder_for_next_occurrence) - it's still
    "active", just not due yet. Originally this only filtered on
    status='pending', which meant a recurring reminder rescheduled for
    tomorrow evening would still intercept and Gemini-classify every
    message the kid sent tomorrow MORNING as a possible confirmation of
    something they weren't even being nagged about yet. Filtering on
    next_trigger_at <= now restricts this to reminders that have actually
    started nagging this cycle (or are a one-off already due), matching
    the same "is this actually due" gate get_due_persistent_reminders uses.

    If more than one is pending for the same number at once (e.g. two
    different parents each nagged the same kid about something different),
    only the most recent one is checked - a deliberate simplification for this
    bot's small-family scale, not a real ambiguity-resolution mechanism.
