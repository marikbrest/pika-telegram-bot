# Roadmap

What would make Pika better, roughly in priority order. Pick something and say so in the
issue; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [docs/ADDING_A_TOOL.md](./docs/ADDING_A_TOOL.md).

## Wanted (open to contributors)

- **More languages, and the rest of the strings.** `LOCALE` (`he`, `en`) and the catalogs in `src/locales/` exist; still
  Hebrew-only are the admin dashboard (`src/admin_handler.py`), tool descriptions, the classification prompts and the
  provider-switch phrases in `src/ai.py`. A new language is one `src/locales/<code>.py` file.
- **More LLM providers.** OpenAI is built in as an optional per-user provider
  ([docs/ADDING_A_PROVIDER.md](./docs/ADDING_A_PROVIDER.md)); Anthropic or a local OpenAI-compatible server would each be one adapter
  module plus a registry entry.
- **Other channels.** Telegram specifics live in `src/integrations/telegram.py` and `src/telegram_handler.py`;
  a Signal/Matrix adapter would reuse the whole tool pipeline. (The WhatsApp version of Pika is a separate project.)
- **Deployment recipes:** a systemd unit, a Caddy/Traefik compose example as an alternative to
  Cloudflare Tunnel, a Kubernetes manifest.
- **Welcome message for new users** with the privacy policy and terms links ([#17](https://github.com/marikbrest/pika-personal-whatsapp-bot/issues/17)).
- **`scripts/delete_user.py`**: remove a user and all their data in one step ([#18](https://github.com/marikbrest/pika-personal-whatsapp-bot/issues/18)).
- **Real screenshots** of the setup flow for `docs/SETUP_TELEGRAM.md`.
- **Type hints and `mypy`** on the core modules.
- **Test coverage report** in CI.

## Ideas (needs discussion first)

- iOS Shortcuts / Focus-mode signals feeding the proactive "busy" status.
- Trip and event preparation (flight detection, destination weather, packing doc).
- Dockerised optional integrations (Zabbix/UniFi examples) behind compose profiles.

## Done

See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).
