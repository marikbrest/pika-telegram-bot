"""
Google OAuth2 - connecting Gmail + Calendar through a link-based consent flow.

Since the bot lives in Telegram rather than a website, the flow is:
1. The user asks to connect Gmail over Telegram
2. The bot builds a Google OAuth link and sends it as a message
3. The user approves in the browser; Google redirects to /oauth/callback
4. The code here exchanges the code for tokens, encrypts and stores them

The OAuth "state" also carries which user_id requested the connection (there is
no conventional web session here). It is encrypted with Fernet, which makes it
both tamper-proof (signed) and self-expiring (10 minutes, via the ttl argument
to Fernet.decrypt).
