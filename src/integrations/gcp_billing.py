"""
Real Google Cloud billing costs (2026-09-14), via the standard usage cost
BigQuery export enabled the same day on the Gemini API key's own project
(gen-lang-client-0037767834, billing account "My Billing Account" -
018AA3-EFD7A9-6D2E58) - see webhook_handler._handle_usage_status for how
this is presented alongside the existing token-based estimate.

A dedicated service account (pika-bot-billing-reader), not reused from
anywhere else in this codebase: scoped to exactly two roles on this one
project (BigQuery Data Viewer, BigQuery Job User) via its own JSON key
(credentials/gcp_billing_service_account.json, gitignored) - it cannot read
or do anything outside that one export table, unlike the Gmail/Calendar
OAuth credentials, which are the user's own broad personal grant.

Billing export is NOT retroactive - the export table only starts existing
once the first daily export actually lands (Google's own documented
latency: usually within ~24 hours of enabling export, not instant). A
missing table is the expected, normal state for the first day, not an
error - get_month_to_date_cost treats that the same as any other query
failure: log and return None, letting the caller fall back to the
token-based estimate that already existed before this.
