# 2026-09-26: single-instance guard, found necessary after a REAL live
# incident - two full copies of this process ended up running at once
# (both from ONE Start-Process call in scripts/start_assistant.ps1, same
# PID creation timestamp down to the second; the Windows-level mechanism
# was never pinned down despite real investigation, but the effect was
# reproduced twice in a row). Only one of the two ever actually held
# 127.0.0.1:8000 - the other was a fully live orphan nobody could see from
# the webhook traffic or from watching the "winning" process's own log,
# because start_scheduler_loop() below runs at IMPORT time, unconditionally,
# before uvicorn's own socket bind even happens - so the loser still got a
# fully independent scheduler and used it to send at least one real
# Telegram message (a Google-reconnect alert) with no trace anywhere an
# operator would think to look.
#
# _SINGLE_INSTANCE_LOCK_PORT is bound synchronously via a plain socket
# (not through uvicorn/asyncio - whatever let two processes coexist on
# 8000 clearly isn't reliable) and held for the process's entire lifetime
# via this module-level reference, which keeps the OS-level exclusive bind
# alive. A second process attempting the same bind gets a normal,
# unambiguous OSError and exits immediately, before the scheduler (or
# anything else) ever starts - "the port is taken" is the ONE guarantee a
# plain synchronous TCP bind still gives on this box, even though the
# app's real port apparently didn't.
