    Called every DAILY_MEETINGS_SUMMARY_CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES minutes (see

    (users.daily_meetings_summary_enabled), checks whether "now" in their
    OWN timezone has reached their OWN configured send time
    (daily_meetings_summary_time, 'HH:MM', default '07:00' - see
    src/tools/batch13.py for how a user changes it) and today's send hasn't
    already gone out, and if so sends today's calendar summary.

    2026-09-17: the send time became per-user configurable (was a single
    fixed 07:00 for everyone) - the admin asked for this after the other
    parent wanted 9:00 and the bot could only offer a flat 7:00. A single
    daily cron slot
    can't serve N different per-user times, so this switched from one
    fixed-hour cron trigger to a frequent interval check, with
    daily_meetings_summary_last_sent_date (the user's own local date) as an
    explicit "already handled today" marker - without it, this would
    re-send (or re-alert) on every single poll once the target time has
    passed for the day, not just once.

    Reuses morning_brief._calendar_section rather than reimplementing the
    fetch/format - same real-data-only, no-Gemini formatting the on-demand
    morning brief already uses.

    2026-09-16: unlike the on-demand brief (which just omits a failed
    section), a "calendar sync failed" situation here gets an explicit
    message WITH the reconnect link right away, rather than the user only
    finding out incidentally via the next day's 06:00 UTC
    check_google_token_health run. Only NotConnectedError/
    GoogleAuthExpiredError get this treatment - _calendar_section still
    swallows any OTHER, non-auth failure internally and returns None for
    it; that case is deliberately NOT marked as "sent today", so it keeps
    retrying at the next poll rather than waiting until tomorrow (a
    transient failure should recover within minutes, not a full day).

    2026-09-17: retries the fetch ONCE before concluding it's a genuine auth
    failure - found live that a single transient hiccup talking to Google
    (get_credentials(force_refresh=True) doing a real network round-trip to
    Google's token endpoint, which can fail transiently like any network
    call) was enough to trigger the "you need to reconnect" message even
    though the connection was completely healthy moments later (confirmed
    by manually re-running the exact same fetch right after a real alert
    fired - it succeeded cleanly). A single flaky attempt telling the user
    their Google connection is dead is worse than a few extra seconds of
    delay, so now only a failure that repeats on retry gets reported (and,
    once reported, IS marked as sent-today - alerting every few minutes for
    a genuinely dead connection would be its own kind of spam).

    genuinely new one someone else added (e.g. a shared-calendar invite).

    should_deliver_now underneath (quiet hours, an explicit "busy" status,
    the daily cap) regardless of what the judgment call decided. This
    collector never calls send_text_message directly, so it cannot
    accidentally bypass either layer.

    First-run guard: a user's very first poll (calendar_snapshot has no

    Context-Aware Gatekeeper, stage 2 (2026-09-27) - proactive email
    monitoring. For every proactive_settings.enabled=1 user with Google
    connected: fetches mail from the last day, diffs against
    gmail_seen_messages to find genuinely new ones since the last poll,
    classifies them in ONE batched Gemini call (gmail.classify_new_emails),
    and notifies for the categories worth interrupting for - urgent_vip,
    bill_deadline, meeting_invite. "shipment" is left to the existing
    package tracker (track_package), which already owns that whole flow;
    "other" stays silent by design, same as the plan's own framing.

    Uses list_recent_emails(query="newer_than:1d") rather than Gmail's own
    History API - simpler, and avoids that API's own historyId-invalidation
    recovery path entirely, at the cost of re-querying a day's mail every
    poll instead of a true delta. gmail_seen_messages is what actually
    makes this a "new since last poll" diff, not the query itself.

    First-run guard (has_any_gmail_seen_message): a user's very first poll
    after enabling proactive mode only SEEDS gmail_seen_messages, silently
    - without this, opting in would immediately report every email from
    the last 24h as if it just arrived, the same flood
    check_and_monitor_calendar_changes's own first-run guard avoids for
    calendar events.

    Every classified email goes through proactive.assess_and_deliver - a
    real Gemini judgment call on whether it's actually worth interrupting
    for right now, cross-referencing the user's own calendar (identifier=
    the sender's own email address, so a VIP sender's message can bypass
    quiet hours underneath) - this collector never calls send_text_message
    directly, so it cannot accidentally skip either layer.

    Per-user error isolation (12.3) - one user's broken Google connection,
    or a classification failure, must never block the check for anyone else.
