"""
Fetches a URL and extracts its main article text (stripped of nav/ads/
boilerplate), for the "saved links" feature - the point is a permanent copy
of the actual content, not just the URL, per PRD founding principle #1.

Fetching is done with our own httpx client (same browser-like headers as
markets.py) rather than letting trafilatura fetch on its own, so every
outbound HTTP call in this codebase shares one consistent timeout/header
convention.
