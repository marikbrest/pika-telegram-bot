"""
PRD 'every table is user_id-scoped from day one; mutations verify ownership
(IDOR defence), not just correctly-scoped fetches'. This file exists because
that is a claim in a docstring/PRD, not something enforced by the type
system - if a future edit drops the ' AND user_id = ?' clause from any of
these queries, this suite is what would actually notice.

Pattern for every case: user A creates something, user B (a real, distinct,
otherwise-legitimate account - not an attacker guessing IDs from the
outside) tries to touch it by its real, correctly-guessed id, and the
mutation must refuse. This is the more important half of the property:
"scoped to the wrong owner" is what an IDOR bug looks like, not "id doesn't
exist" (which is a different, boring case every one of these functions
already gets right too).
